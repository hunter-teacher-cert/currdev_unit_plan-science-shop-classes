## General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

This unit provides students with introduction to key ideas in computer science and skills in logo programming language
in Earth Science classes during the astronomy unit. NetLogo allows students to explore coding in a more visually appealing manner. It also hosts a vast library of models such as a climate change model in which it can be used to explore its variables, and later explore its limitations to predict climate change.

## Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

For many students, computers are thought of as consumer electronics, not as a medium for putting their own ideas into reality.
Students typically do not get to have experience at school or at home to realize that they can actually create useful products themselves.
This unit is created to make a small dent in helping children think of themselves as creative thinkers who can turn their ideas into reality. It also serves to demonstrate the benefits and limitations of real-world tools such as computer simulations.

## Standards Referenced
Standards utilized from NYSED 9-12 Computer Science Standards (http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-9-12.pdf)

- 9-12.CT.1 Create a simple digital model that makes predictions of outcomes.
- 9-12.CT.2 Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.
- 9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.
- 9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent
- 9-12.IC.1 Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
- 9-12.IC.3 Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.
- 9-12.IC.7 Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.


In these Earth Science computer programming lessons, students will learn how
to design and implement simple programs that recreate observations of planetary orbits.
These simple models are attempts to predict how planets will move in the future. We also take a brief look at the benefits of computer simulations as well as its limitations.

## Resources
(include any links/books/readings to be used during this unit)
1. Thanks to clouds, new climate simulations predict more warming than predecessors (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/194738/thanks-clouds-climate-simulations-predict-more/)
2. How reliable are climate models? (https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm)
3. Climate simulations are mostly accurate, study finds (https://apnews.com/article/science-ap-top-news-climate-climate-change-9898308e485f8dea65adb699cb2054a0)

- day 1. lesson on iteration (loop)
- day 2. lesson on procedure
- day 3. lesson on variable, passing by parameters to procedures
- day 4. lesson on recursion and conditional
- day 5. lesson on constructing a circle
- day 6. lesson on constructing an elliptical orbit of a planet around the sun
- day 7. lesson on obtaining geographical elevation data and prepare data for NetLogo
- day 8. lesson on drainage pattern with GIS 2D NetLogo modeling  
- day 9. lesson on climate change model found within NetLogo library
- day 10. lesson on exploring limitations of models like the climate change model in NetLogo and its implications.
