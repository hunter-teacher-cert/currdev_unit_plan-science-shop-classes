# Aim: How do we obtain GIS data for NetLogo programs?
## Objectives
 * Obtain elevation data from USDA GIS interactive map
 * Obtain elevation data from USGS GIS library
 * Prepare the data from GIS system to be ready for use in NetLogo

## NYS COMPUTER SCIENCE AND DIGITAL FLUENCY LEARNING STANDARDS
 * **9-12.IC.7** Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
 * **9-12.CT.4** Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and
   third-party functions to  organize the computation.

## Warm Up
Time: 5 minutes  
Teacher directs students to download qGIS software at https://www.qgis.org/en/site/.
Once students download a copy of qGIS software to their computers, they should
install the qGIS software.

## Lesson Content
Time: 20 minutes

### Elevation Data from GIS interactive map
- Search for the phrase geospatial data gateway
- Click on **Get Data** button, then click on the green link called HERE
- Click on **Order by Interactive Map"
- Once you zoom into an area where you want its elevation data
- Click on Select area button, and select an area of interest with your mouse.
- Click on accept area, and Check National Elevation Dataset
- Click Continue button, and then another continue
- Provide your email, and then click **Place Order**

Students opened their email and download the zip file from USDA.
Students are then instructed to go to the browser panel to drag the tif file combinationthe project area. A new layer will be automatically created.
Once students are finished or even if they run into obstacles, students
are directed to watch a video that explains how to obatin GIS data from
USDA and USGS: https://youtu.be/VlKkAYoNoRE (Title: Download Free Elevation Data (DEM) from the USGS National Map and NRCS Geospatial Data Gateway).

## Lesson Activity  
Time: 15 minutes

Students will watch part of a video clip to learn how to convert a raster file
to asc file. https://youtu.be/_qR9lZy6xjE (Title: NetLogo and QGIS - Converting GIS files to patches in NetLogo). Students will open GIS data in qGIS and do a vector
conversion to translate to a ASCII file. Students will have to name the asc file
that they want to save. Once students are finished with the three tasks, they
can make a note for themselves of how they obtain GIS file and prepare ASC file
so that they can refer to Today's steps for future reference.

## Closing  
Time: 5 minutes  

Students present their notes to the other students in the class. The notes
are directions for themselves on how to obtain GIS data for no cost and how to
prepare the data in a format that NetLogo can understand. (possibly 2 days
given the time it takes to download GIS software and GIS data and the amount
of time to replay the video instruction on how to obtain GIS elevation data).

## Explanation
The lesson is designed for students who will write program in NetLogo to produce
virtual models of Earth Science.
