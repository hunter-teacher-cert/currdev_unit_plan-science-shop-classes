# Aim: How can computer simulations improve our understanding of climate change?

## Objectives

- Utilize NetLogo climate change model from model library to manipulate variables and record outcomes
- Simulate Earth’s current situation and possible outcome if climate change is not addressed at various future outcomes (5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now).

## **NYS COMPUTER SCIENCE AND DIGITAL FLUENCY LEARNING STANDARDS**
- 9-12.IC.1 Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
- 9-12.IC.7 Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
## Warm Up

Time: 5 minutes

Teacher instructs students to obtain computers, sign in, and enter NetLogo. Teacher will instruct students to find the Climate Change Earth Science Model from within the model library.

## Lesson Content

Time: 15 minutes

Teacher will probe student background knowledge of climate change and its relationship to carbon dioxide. The instructor will create a list of key details that students mention. The teacher will seek to create a list that includes at minimum the following details:

1. Climate change will have devastating effects on the environment
2. Climate change is occurring due to human activity
3. Climate change is directly related to an increase in greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide
4. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of human industrialization
5. Carbon dioxide traps the Sun’s UV rays from escaping Earth’s atmosphere

The teacher will add onto the class list if these details are missing. 

## Lesson Activity

Time: 20 minutes

Students will be tasked to explore the NetLogo Climate Change model. They will be reminded to change one variable at a time. Students will be asked the following questions, which will be displayed on the board:

1. What happens to sunlight rays as they enter Earth’s atmosphere? Do they always bounce out of Earth’s atmosphere?
2. Run the model with a sun brightness of 1, albedo of 0.6, no clouds and no CO2 added. What is the highest temperature it reaches?
3. Run the model with a sun brightness of higher than 1, albedo of 0.6, no clouds and no CO2 added. What temperature difference, if any, do you notice?
4. Run the model with a sun brightness of 1, albedo of 0.6, no clouds and change the CO2 to a number higher than 0. What is the highest temperature you can reach?
5. Using the previous model settings you used, begin to add clouds. What effect do clouds have on the temperature? Start off by adding a few clouds and progressively add more clouds.
6. Run the model with a sun brightness of 1, no clouds, and no CO2 added. Change the albedo to below 0.6. What effect does this have? Change the albedo to higher than 0.6 what effect does this have?
7. Try to get the highest temperature possible!

Students will be asked to record all their findings in their notebooks.

## Closing

Time: 5 minutes

The teacher will go through the list of questions and ask students for their responses, ideas, and reactions to their findings. 

## Explanation

This lesson serves to allow students to manipulate particular variables and see the effect of carbon dioxide on global temperatures. This lesson serves as a precursor for the next lesson in which students will be questioning and researching the efficiency, reliability, and validity behind computer models such as this one.
