# Aim: Can we rely on computer models to predict future climate change?

## Objectives

- Investigate the efficacy of computer simulations as they pertain to predicting climate change.
- To explore the limitations of computer simulations as they pertain to climate change modeling.

## **NYS COMPUTER SCIENCE AND DIGITAL FLUENCY LEARNING STANDARDS**

- 9-12.IC.1 Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
- 9-12.IC.3 Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.

## Warm Up

Time: 5 minutes

Students will enter, sign into their computers and access Google Classroom. In Google Classroom they will access the assignment labeled “Can we rely on computer models to predict future climate change?” Within this assignment are 3 articles in pdf format. 

## Lesson Content

Time: 10 minutes

The teacher will instruct students to reflect on the previous lesson. The teacher will ask students to write down if they believe the climate change model found in NetLogo is accurate enough to predict the effects of climate change.

Students will share their responses with the class. 

## Lesson Activity

Time: 20 minutes

Students will be asked to read 3 articles: 

1. **Thanks to clouds, new climate simulations predict more warming than predecessors (**[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/194738/thanks-clouds-climate-simulations-predict-more/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/194738/thanks-clouds-climate-simulations-predict-more/))
2. How reliable are climate models? ([https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm](https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm))
3. **Climate simulations are mostly accurate, study finds** ([https://apnews.com/article/science-ap-top-news-climate-climate-change-9898308e485f8dea65adb699cb2054a0](https://apnews.com/article/science-ap-top-news-climate-climate-change-9898308e485f8dea65adb699cb2054a0))

Students will then be asked to write a short response about their opinion on the current climate change models. They will be asked to support their answers with evidence from the articles or from other credible sources found on the web. They will also be asked to utilize their experience with the climate change model in NetLogo from the previous lesson.

Some student responses will be shared aloud. 

## Closing

Time: 10 minutes

Students will be asked in pairs to list some factors that should be in every climate change model. A short list will be compiled from student answers and displayed on the board.

## Explanation

This lesson seeks to allow students to explore the limitations of computer simulations. Students will read articles that share opposing opinions on climate change computer simulations.
